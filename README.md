ConwaysGameOfLife
=================

My implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Java

What's cool about this implementation is that I added an easier way to create boards.
You can use an image file and have each pixel represent a cell.
A colored cell represents the dead cell. The white cell is a live cell.
That will be the seed. Then there are things like manipulating the frame rate, color of cells, and 
changing the size of the cells.
